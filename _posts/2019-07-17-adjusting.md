### Setting the Scene

> I survived my first day at UCR, shaken-up but alive. I went to sleep and woke up the next day. "Wait, didn't the quarter start yesterday, how is it already week 3?" I sneezed, and then finals descended upon us and the quarter was over before I knew what had happened. "Seriously, how is it already over?" 

This was my exact thought process my first quarter at UCR in Fall 2015. The transition from semester to quarter system is a struggle unique to transfer students. The purpose of this post is to inform you of what my experience was like, and provide you with some thing I did to help me survive. Hopefully, you will walk away from this post with a better idea about how to adjust than I had.

### The Pace

The semester system consists of a 16-week "season" of classes. Even if you love your classes, the semester system feels like it drags on...and on...and on...and on... The quarter system on the other hand is the opposite end of this spectrum. A quarter consists of a 10-week long "season" of classes. The quarter system is **fast**. I'm talking really fast. I knew -in my bones- that it was fast before I transferred and it still caught me off guard. I am not trying to scare you but I do want to put this in perspective. 

>Pro TIp #1: However fast you think the quarter system is, it is faster.

This is the first hurdle you will have to overcome as a transfer student. This is the single piece of advice I tell every single transfer student. However fast you think the quarter system is , it is faster. 

What would I do differently? 

**Take your classes as seriously as you can right from the first day.** 

The pace of the quarter system highlighted a discrepancy in my internal time scale regarding how I approached my classes. At my community college, the first week or two was always pretty relaxed. Personally, it didn't *feel* like classes started until about the third week, even though we had been covering material. Stating this in a slightly more critical way: I didn't take my classes seriously until about the third week. That is when I would start all my "scholarly" habits of reviewing notes and reading the book. In the quarter system, there is no time to "ramp up" or "get going" as the quarter progresses. It is far better just to just "be going" at the onset. One strategy I used was to pretend that the first day of the quarter was week 3 and to proceed from there. This helped me move past the thoughts of "all we did today was derive a single simple equation, I don't need to review this."

### The Workload

One consequence that emerges due to the pace of the quarter system is that if you fall behind in your school work, you will stay behind, and it is very easy to fall behind.

> Pro Tip #2: Stay on top of your school work.

During my undergrad, lots of my friends, both transfer and traditional students, fell behind and it was very painful for me to watch them play catch-up, essentially drowning, all quarter. They were miserable, they made others including myself miserable; it was just all around a bad time. As transfers, we are especially prone to this problem because we are coming from a system that is intrinsically slower. If you have internalized Pro-Tip #1, then you can naturally avoid this problem. If you are taking your classes seriously from day one, there will (hopefully) never be a time when you fall behind in the first place and you can avoid this pain-train altogether. 

What I did to stay on top of my school work:

I developed a feedback system that allowed me to constantly monitor my performance and adjust as needed. It involves asking yourself three questions, from three different points of view in time. These questions are (loosely):

1. What did I do yesterday that was helpful or not helpful? Did I accomplish everything I needed to?
2. What do I need to get done today? Is there anything today that I can do better than yesterday?
3. Are there things I can do today that will help me tomorrow? In a week? In a month?

The goal with these is to increase your mental timescale. It is very easy to get lost in the day-to-day, moment-to-moment chaos of the quarter. This is equivalent to losing sight of the forest for the trees. In more concrete terms, instead of seeing **1** quarter, you might see **3** months, or you might see **10** weeks, or you might see **70** days. (I have worked hard to adjust to the 10 week perspective) These questions help me take a step back from the day-to-day chaos and critically evaluate myself. 

### Small, Healthy Increments

Taking a step back is useful. This helps you keep in mind the "big picture" goals that you have. If you have a clear picture of what you want your UCR experience to be before you get here, that is great, you are already ahead of the curve. If you don't know what you want your UCR experience to be, that is also okay. 

> Pro Tip #3: Gradually take on more responsibility.

My first quarter at UCR, I didn't do anything "extra" other than the regular classwork and the Highlander pep-band. Before I transferred, I knew, with certainty, that I wanted to do research or at the very least try it. I also had a vague idea of what I wanted my UCR experience to look like, meaning I knew vaguely what I wanted to do at UCR (get good grades, do research, join a club or two) If I attempted all of these my first quarter, I knew that I would have crashed and burned. Even though as a transfer, I knew that I had to make every minute at UCR count, and to some degree, my decision *not* to do research felt like I was wasting time, this was absolutely the right decision for me. My only goal for my first quarter was to survive, both academically and physiologically. (This was the first time I had lived on my own so if I didn't cook food, I didn't eat.) If I had taken on anything more than band I would have drown. What I did do though was identify professors who were doing things that sounded interesting. This way when I did feel ready to start research, I already knew who to talk to. 

The approach I took was to add one more "thing" each quarter if you feel comfortable. My first quarter, I joined the UCR band. My second quarter, I started research. My third quarter, I joined a different lab. The Fall of the following year, I joined the UCR Science Ambassadors. (If you are interested in what the Science Ambassador program is, email me) I also became more involved in SPS. By my senior year, I held a leadership position in the Science Ambassadors and in SPS, I had given research talks at conferences, and I was on my way to publishing my first paper. There is time to do everything, I promise.

### The Time You Spend at UCR

This next bit is not applicable to all my fellow transfer students for a multitude of reasons. I do though highly advise this though If you are capable of doing so.

> (Optional) Pro-Tip #4: Take three years to complete your degree.

While in theory, completing your degree, and doing research is possible in two years, it is not fun. One of my transfer friends took two years to finish his degree and do research and he told me he regretted not taking a third year even though he could have. This meant that he was taking a minimum of 16 units every quarter and doing research. Ultimately, he succeeded but he felt that he could have gotten so much more out of his experience if he had taken another year. 

I took three years to complete my degree, and I echo his sentiment. While yes, I probably could have done my degree and research in two years, that extra third year was absolutely worth it.

### Conclusions

The quarter system is fast. This is something that you will have to adjust to. You are not alone in this struggle, you have the rest of the transfer students in your cohort to talk who are all experiencing the same thing, and you also have me.

Stay on top of your class work. The nature of the quarter system means that it is easy to fall behind and stay behind. This is just all around a bad time for everyone.

Don't overload yourself the first quarter. If you have a clear picture of what you want your UCR experience to be, that is great and I promise you have time to do it all. You don't have a lot of time, but you do have enough to do everything you want to, you just have to be strategic about it.

If you are capable, take three years to do your degree. This allows you to soak up as much as you possibly can from UCR.
