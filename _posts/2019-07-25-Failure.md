# Dealing with Failure

This post is about dealing with failure, in any sense of the word, at all intensities. There will be times you mess up a little, I've dropped lots of minus signs and factors of 2. There will also be times when you *really* mess up. To start, lets focus on the times when you mess up a little, "small" failures, whatever "small" means. I've give you some examples from my own life and how I have learned to handle them. Then we will focus on a particular event in the scientific community when an experiment *really* messed up and see what we can learn about being gracious in failure.

### Personal Story Time

Here is a **small** sample of times that I have "failed" and how I have learned to handle failures:

1. Failing in front of my advisor / research group.

   During group meetings, I will present something, something that I am supposed to understand. My advisor will ask me a question in front of the whole group while I am standing at a white board, and I won't be able to answer it. In some sense, I have failed, he has asked something of me and I cannot deliver. 

2. Failing in front of other professors. 

   In other cases, I have been talking about research projects that I am doing with other faculty members. They will ask a question, that I should be able to answer, and expect an answer that I can't provide. More failure. 

3. Graduate school applications. 

   My graduate school application process was almost exclusively rejection, almost exclusively failure. I applied to I think 9 graduate schools and I was rejected by all but one, and that one was my undergrad institution.

The point is, there are a lot of ways you can and will fail. Here is one way I deal with it:

> Mindset Tip #1: Try to frame what you might typically consider failure as a temporary postponement of success.

Yeah, this is cheesy I know, but there is some power in this. As an academic, what I would consider as one of my ultimate goals is to continue learning. So yes, at that particular moment in time, I couldn't answer my advisors questions, but that doesn't mean that I can't learn the answers later. Yes, I was rejected by all the graduate schools I applied to except one, but the point is that I am still here, in graduate school, on the path to a PhD, still learning.

Framed in this way, events that you might initially consider a "failure" turn into an event that slightly delays your path towards success. This mindset has been invaluable throughout my first year of graduate school and I am sure will continue to be invaluable as I continue.

Let's move onto how to handle messing up *really* bad. 

**Disclaimer**: The purpose of this section is not to burn or pass judgement on the OPERA collaboration or any of its members. We are using the OPERA collaboration to try to understand i) what to do when you fail, and ii) how you can frame failure in a healthy way so that when (yes when, not if) you fail, it doesn't shut you down. I am using this particular experiment as an example because, and I'm being completely honest here, this is the first (and only) one I could think of, and at the level of the word "failure," claiming a result that directly violates a physical law is an incredibly powerful statement to stand by.

### The "Faster Than Light" Claim

Back in 2011, you may have heard about a team of physicists claiming to have measured particles, neutrinos to be precise, moving faster than the speed of light. For the avid reader, the original paper in all its glory can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4897). A readers digest of the "faster than light" claim can be found on slide 53 of this [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/155620/) given at CERN. 

This "faster than light" claim, superluminal as it is called in the business, is in clear violation of the first thing we are taught when we learn special relativity: nothing can move faster than light. Not only was the OPERA collaboration brave enough to announce this, they stood by it, with 6-$\sigma$ confidence. For reference, the threshold to claim the discovery of a new particle in the field of particle physics is 5-$\sigma$. If you are interested, the problem ultimately turned out to be a single cable.

Put yourself in the shoes of the OPERA collaboration for a minute. You have a world-class detector and you make a measurement that violates one of the fundamental assumptions of special relativity. You even back it up, saying that you have more confidence in this measurement than when a new particle is discovered.

As you can expect, the physics community was set ablaze by this claim and immediately began follow up studies. On one hand were theorists showing the physical consequences of superluminal travel, and how screwed up some of the predictions of general relativity would be. On the other hand, some theorists supposed that maybe our understanding of special relativity were incomplete, and tried to find a theoretical framework in which this measurement was consistent. 

How did OPERA react? Upon presenting this superluminal "anomaly" at a seminar at CERN, Antonio Ereditato, the director of the OPERA collaboration from 2008 to 2012, told a Nautilus journalist in [this article](http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/the-data-that-threatened-to-break-physics):

> “You come out in a science conference, a seminar, and you start saying, ‘Hey guys, I have something which I don’t understand. Please help us in understanding.’ ”

Antonio here is demonstrating what I consider to be the very essence of what it means to be a researcher.

> Mindset Tip #2: Our jobs as researchers is to increase the collective knowledge of humankind

As academics, we are all united with this goal, even if we don't feel it permeate into our everyday lives. Lets frame Antonio's reaction in a more provocative way as a way to understand how to apply this midset. The world has asked the OPERA collaboration what these results mean. The OPERA collaboration is admitting that they do not have an answer. (Perhaps they have failed in some sense) They themselves are unable to contribute knowledge to humankind, but they are asking for help that ultimately _someone else_ can. Framed in this way, with the goal being to increase the knowledge of humankind, the OPERA collaboration succeeded, even if it wasn't the OPERA collaboration that made the contribution.

The person that introduced me to this idea: that when _you_ fail, you don't learn anything, but the _community_ as a whole does, is Anson D’Aloisio, a professor of physics at UCR. 

### Concluding Remarks

Failure is not an easy subject to handle and it takes time and lots of mindfulness and practice to get better at handling failure. I will leave you with something that one of my friends casually said in passing that I have found incredibly helpful in my own personal journey.

> "Being wrong is most of what physics [research] is, it is something to learn how to be good at." - Alex Mercaldi

During my first year of grad school, my friend Alex said this in passing and it has stuck with me ever since. A lot of physics in general, not just research is being wrong, and dealing with being wrong, and getting stuck, and figuring out how to not be stuck. This single quote has helped me frame the idea of failure in a much healthier way. I would sum this up as, learning how to be gracious in failure.
