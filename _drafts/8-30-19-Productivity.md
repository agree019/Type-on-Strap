This post has to do with feeling like you "aren't productive enough." If anything, I want to make you aware that this feeling is legitimate, and inform you that it exists. At community college, I never experienced this feeling, I got everyhting done that I needed to, when I needed to. I was "productive enough." After transferring, I experienced times where I would think to myself "I shouldhave been able to get more done today." This was my first exposure to feeling like I had not "done enough" that day. The majority of my insights in this post come from the first year of graduate school, where every day I felt like should have been more productive. 

## Setting the Scene

It is week 7 of the quarter, what I refer to as "grind time." You have ascended to a new plane of "being tired," you feel the exhaustion in your bones, in your soul. You have been getting enough sleep to function every day, but only barely. You eat maybe twice a day, whenever you have time, but the amount of coffee you have been drinking has almost permanently suppressed your hunger. You've got assignments due next week in every class, all on the same day. You make a game plan for the next week, outline when you need to have things done, you've set expectations for yourself.
