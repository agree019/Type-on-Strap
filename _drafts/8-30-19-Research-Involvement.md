This post is my journey through undergraduate reserach, focusing particularly on how I got my foot in the door. 


Before I transferred into UCR, I knew that I wanted to do research, but I had no idea in what field. It can be a little daunting walking up to a professor and interacting with them but I promise, they are people too and they would love to talk with you about their reserach. 


My first experience was in condensed matter. Jeanie Lau, who has since moved to Ohio State, advertised in PHYS 130B that she was looking for undergrads in her lab, and I siezed the moment and approached her after class. 


After learning that I did not enjoy physically going somewhere to do reserach, I asked Owen Long if I could work with him. In an attempt to make myself more attractive as a potential student, I said something along the lines of "I want to work with you next quarter, is there anything I can do now to prepare myself."
